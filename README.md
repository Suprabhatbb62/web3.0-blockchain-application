Web 3.0 is a possible future version of the internet based on public blockchains, a record-keeping system best known for facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. The attractiveness of Web 3.0 is that it is decentralized. Our developed project Web 3.0 Application On Ethereum Blockchain has the following results.

5. Whenever we send a transaction request, our application sends a request to the connected wallet. When a user agrees to the request, the transaction is processed.![tut5](https://github.com/Suprabhatbb62/web3.0-blockchain-application/assets/86051393/33ffc76e-a80b-4d49-87c1-a203e9360d87)
